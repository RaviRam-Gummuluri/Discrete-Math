# Discrete Math Lab 2: Quantifiers

This is a solution for the Discrete Math Lab 2 assignment, focusing on working with quantifiers in propositional logic. It provides functionality to handle statements with logical quantifiers such as "there exists" and "for all."

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## Usage

1. Run the program

2. Enter the propositional statement when prompted. Use "there_exists" for "there exists" and "_all" for "for all". For example:

    Enter the propositional statement: there_exists P(x)


3. The program will provide the step-by-step solution and display the answer.

## Example

Enter the propositional statement: there_exists P(x)

Ques: there_exists P(x)

Step 1: ~(there_exists x) P(x)
Answer: ~(P(1) v P(2) v P(3) v P(4) v P(5))
